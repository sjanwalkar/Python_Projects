# Python_Projects

Project to build a python program using Greedy method or Dynamic Programming to seperate points projected on x-y plane with lines parallel to X and Y axis 
The project builds a Greedy method in O(n^4) time complexity to provide the optimal solution i.e. least numbers of lines required to isolate each points.
